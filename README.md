# Empowerment-paper
The main contribution of this paper is to show that two intrinsic reward functions, the Causal Path Entropy and Empowerment, are equivalent only in deterministic environments. In non-deterministic environments, it is shown that the Causal Path Entropy has fundamental weaknesses compared to Empowerment. Moreover, the author demonstrates that the difference between Causal Path Entropy and Empowerment can't be increased without diminishing Empowerment.

## Shakir's question:

One motivation for writing this paper is that it addresses a question embedded in the following tweet by Shakir Mohamed, a research scientist at DeepMind:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/robertsdionne?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@robertsdionne</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hugo_larochelle?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@hugo_larochelle</a> Empowerment and causal entropic forces are related -not yet sure how. Transfer Entropy might be useful too.</p>&mdash; Shakir Mohamed (@shakir_za) <a href="https://twitter.com/shakir_za/status/654929305567428608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2015</a></blockquote>

Having said that, additional motivation came from discussions with other researchers who appeared to confuse the relation between Causal Path Entropy
and Empowerment.
