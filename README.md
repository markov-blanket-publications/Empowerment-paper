# Empowerment-paper

Motivated by discussions with reinforcement learning
researchers who believed that these two theories were
equivalent and others who did not know the relation
between them, the main contribution of this paper is to show that two intrinsic reward functions, the Causal Path Entropy and Empowerment, are equivalent only in deterministic environments. In non-deterministic environments, it is shown that the Causal Path Entropy has fundamental weaknesses compared to Empowerment. Moreover, the author demonstrates that the difference between Causal Path Entropy and Empowerment can't be increased without diminishing Empowerment.
